# Tableau-Project
New York City is a thriving metropolis. Just like most other metros its size, one of the biggest problems. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and traffic leads to a huge number of traffic violation tickets.

In an attempt to scientifically analyze this phenomenon, the NYS Police Department has collected data for violation tickets. Of these, the data files for multiple years are publicly available on Kaggle. For the scope of this analysis, we will analyze the violation tickets over the year 2014 to 2017.

Using Tableau we are going to visualize the data and understand traffic violation patterns that will help NYS Police Department as well as public to reduce the traffic violations, so that public safety is improved.
Also, we can avoid paying more fines for the traffic violations and avoid the risk while driving.
